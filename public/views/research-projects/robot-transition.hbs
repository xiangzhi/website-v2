    <h5>Descriptions</h5>
    <p>With the deployment of robots in our daily lives, it is highly likely that human users are going to interact with more than one robot every day. This project looks into how a user transitions from one robot to another as part of an interaction and explores how these robots should interact with each other in these scenarios.</p>
